# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## Dataset

This project uses the **Sentiment140 dataset**, a widely-used collection of **1.6 million tweets** labeled with sentiments (positive or negative). The dataset is pre-labeled for binary sentiment classification and is used to train machine learning models to predict the sentiment of unseen tweets.

## Model

The sentiment analysis is performed using a **Logistic Regression** model. This model is trained on preprocessed tweet data, where text features are extracted using techniques like **TF-IDF** (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). The trained model predicts whether a tweet expresses a **positive** or **negative** sentiment.
